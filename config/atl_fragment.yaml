# ATL Fragment Configuration
# Defines allowed operators, nesting depth limits, and coalition constraints

# Allowed temporal operators
temporal_operators:
  - X   # neXt
  - F   # Future (eventually)
  - G   # Globally (always)
  - U   # Until

# Allowed boolean connectives
boolean_connectives:
  - "∧"   # AND
  - "∨"   # OR
  - "¬"   # NOT
  - "→"   # IMPLIES

# Strategic modality
strategic_modality:
  # Coalition operators use ⟨⟨ and ⟩⟩
  coalition_open: "⟨⟨"
  coalition_close: "⟩⟩"

# Constraints on formulas
constraints:
  max_nesting_depth: 4    # Maximum depth of nested temporal/strategic operators
  max_coalition_size: 5   # Maximum number of agents in a coalition
  max_agents: 10          # Maximum total number of agents in the system

# Atom naming conventions
atoms:
  prefix: "p"           # Atomic propositions are named p1, p2, etc.
  max_atoms: 20         # Maximum number of distinct atomic propositions

# Agent naming conventions
agents:
  prefix: "a"           # Agents are named a1, a2, etc.
